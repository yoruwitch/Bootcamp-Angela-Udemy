# Second Project: a personal portfolio

* Hello and welcome! This is my second project, following the bootcamp order in Udemy.
* This site (I hope) is meant to be a personal portfolio using HTML and CSS, implemeting more things I'm learning through the course.
* Don't expect, yet, JavaScript or too much elaboreted knowlegde, I'm still learning and doing my best as I can.
